title: Getting the balls rolling
---

## Why?
I am a software developer by profession, as the saying goes: Every good developer should have a blog. Right? So there's that.  But mainly this will be a holding ground for things I wish to re-remember or just find neat.  If others find it helpfull or amusing or whatever that's nice, but mainly it's for me. 

## Getting the ball rolling.
Seemingly, like everythign I try to do, what should have been a 5 minute task `setup github pages blog ` turned into a 3 hour mess.
